## 🧾 Hair by Isentle

### 💇‍♀️ Project Overview
**Hair by Isentle** Isentle, a local entrepreneur selling premium weaves and bundles, was running her business through WhatsApp. One day, her account got hacked. Clients were scammed out of their hard-earned money. Posts started circulating on Facebook. She was trending — but for the wrong reasons. People thought she was the scammer.

I built this site to help her bounce back. No more selling through vulnerable platforms. This site gives her a secure, professional space to showcase her products and take bookings directly — no middleman, no risk..
